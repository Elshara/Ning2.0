# Agent Guidance â€“ `assets/css`

**Scope precedence:** Follow this file for CSS assets before escalating to `assets/AGENTS.md`.

## Expectations
- Keep one logical presentation concern per stylesheet; split large themes into smaller files if they exceed a single responsibility.
- Use modern CSS (no vendor-specific hacks unless documented) and ensure files remain pure CSS.
- Update templates or manifests when relocating or renaming stylesheets and log outstanding work below.

## Change Log
- 2024-05-13: Imported legacy `theme*.css` and `custom*.css` from the repository root.

## Outstanding Tasks
- Audit theme and widget templates for hard-coded links to the old root-level CSS paths.
