# Agent Guidance â€“ `xn_private/`

**Scope precedence:** Follow this file before root guidance for sensitive or private assets stored in
`xn_private/`.

## Modernization Priorities
- Verify whether each private asset is still required. Remove obsolete items after confirming no
  dependencies remain.
- Document missing private resources that installations expect.

## Structural Guidance
- Keep credentials or secrets out of version control. Provide sample templates instead and document
  their usage here.

## Outstanding Work Log
- Record pending removals, replacements, or security reviews for this directory.
