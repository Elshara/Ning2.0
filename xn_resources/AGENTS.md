# Agent Guidance â€“ `xn_resources/`

**Scope precedence:** Apply this guidance before the root instructions within `xn_resources/`.

## Modernization Priorities
- Ensure resources (images, styles, assets) align with current UI expectations and remove obsolete
  items.
- Replace duplicated assets with shared references. Use `php tools/detect_duplicates.php
  xn_resources` to locate redundant files or metadata.

## Structural Guidance
- Organise assets by type and document dependencies or build steps in accompanying README files.
- Track missing assets required by modernised widgets or layouts.

## Outstanding Work Log
- Note assets slated for replacement, removal, or addition here.
