# Agent Guidance â€“ `widgets/events/`

**Scope precedence:** Apply this file to the events widget before consulting `widgets/AGENTS.md`.
Coordinate with `widgets/groups/AGENTS.md` for membership-linked visibility and with
`lib/AGENTS.md` for calendar/timezone helpers.

## Modernization Priorities
- Normalize date/time handling using immutable objects and timezone-aware formatting.
- Consolidate RSVP, invitation, and reminder workflows with the platform-wide notification system.
- Ensure maps/location integrations use modern APIs (HTTPS, up-to-date endpoints). Document missing
  providers or migration tasks in the Outstanding Work Log.

## Structural Guidance
- Separate event creation/editing controllers from listing/browsing controllers. Note pending
  decompositions when logic remains combined.
- Store recurring event logic in dedicated services with clear documentation on expected inputs.

## Testing & Checks
- Add unit tests for recurrence calculation, timezone conversion, and permission enforcement.
- Run `php tools/detect_duplicates.php widgets/events` after edits to keep business logic centralized.

## Outstanding Work Log
- Track outstanding calendar integrations, reminder delivery methods, and accessibility improvements.
