# Agent Guidance â€“ `OpenSocial/`

**Scope precedence:** Follow this file before consulting root guidance when altering OpenSocial
assets.

## Modernization Priorities
- Identify obsolete specifications and replace or remove them. Document compatibility decisions here.
- Consolidate duplicated API facades with the XN layer. Run `php tools/detect_duplicates.php
  OpenSocial XN` when making changes.
- Ensure OAuth and REST helpers meet contemporary security standards.

## Structural Guidance
- Split large service definitions into self-contained modules per specification area.
- Keep schema or protocol documentation synchronized with implementation changes.

## Testing & Checks
- Add integration tests for OpenSocial endpoints touched by your changes.

## Outstanding Work Log
- Track deprecated features pending removal and modernization follow-ups.

## Audit Summary
- Pending lint audit captured for `OpenSocial`. Run `php tools/php_lint_audit.php OpenSocial` to log per-file results in `tmp/audit/php_lint_audit.json` and document follow-up fixes.
- Continue cataloguing PHPFox Legacy, Dolphin, and Cheetah feature gaps relevant to this scope during modernization.
